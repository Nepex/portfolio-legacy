                MotoTrax was a project I worked on from 2016 until 2019. It's the complete package for organizations
                with bus or vehicle fleets to manage and monitor their vehicles. I primarily worked on the frontend with
                light touching of the backend. It has seen many different iterations,
                the first version was coded in RubyOnRails which had to be recoded into AngularJS(Angular1) which I did
                with help from our lead. After which Angular2 was released and we recoded the whole frontend in. All 
                assets belong to AngelTrax.
